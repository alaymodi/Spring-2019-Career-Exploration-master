    "Kaggle is an online platform that hosts machine learning and data analysis competitions. Anyone can create a private Kaggle competition, but there are a lot of public Kaggle competitions hosted by companies, many of which have monetary prizes! Generally the goal of a Kaggle competition is to make a model that accurately predicts a value or classifies data into categories. Participants are given a training dataset with features and labels, as well as an unlabeled test set that will be used to evaluate your final model.\n",

As mentioned already, Kaggle is a great resource for data, since many companies will make their data publicly available so that data scientists around the world can help them answer questions of their own. \n",

    "So far, we've either been 1) working with \"clean\" data, meaning the datasets were generally complete, correct, and of a form making them easy to work with, or 2) conveniently ignoring columns of data that aren't clean. However, not all datasets you come across will be cleaned before they fall in your lap, and ignoring parts of the data that aren't convenient to use won't make for the best models, so you may need to clean the data yourself."

We noticed there were `NaN` values by looking at the raw data and evaluated what kind of data each column contained, which informed our decisions on how to clean our data. We also looked at the counts of `NaN` values in each of the columns, as well as the counts of unique values for some columns to decide whether to drop the column or modify it in some way. We also briefly looked at the survival rates between passengers with assigned `Cabin` values and those without.\n",
